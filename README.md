Hi, I’m Lucia Xie, a student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I'm currently majoring in computer science and minoring in neuroscience, but more specifically, I'm interested in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Right now, I'm open to any professional opportunities related to this field and looking for any internship/research experience. My email is luciaxxie@gmail.com, and my LinkedIn is linked here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucia-xie-942736254/
